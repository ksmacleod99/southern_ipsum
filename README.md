# Southern Ipsum
Another _Lorem Ipsum_ generator. I thought it would be a fun portfolio project. 

## Stack
- Gatsby
- A very forked fork of the Lorem Ipsum NPM package

## To-Dos
- ~Get that state lifted `onSubmit`~
- How do I want to handle how the paragraphs behave if user changes input?
- Figure out how to format the paragraphs as individual paragraphs and not one monster string
- Make it pretty
- ~Clear button~
- Fork and edit the Lorem Ipsum NPM package
- validation for input
- Input field should clear when 'clear' button is clicked
- Stupid 'Lorem Ipsum, y'all' should *not* clear when 'clear' button is clicked

## What I learned/practiced
- Learned about & practiced lifting state
- practiced props vs. state
- played with the `patch-package` dependency to add the southern colloquialisms I needed to make this _Southern Ipsum_.
